## Work Sample for Product Aspect, Python Variant

### Who Am I? And What Would I Learn

I am a second year computer science student at University of Toronto looking for summer internships.
I am looking to not only further my career as a software developer but to hone my programming skills
via workplace environments and mentorship.

These sample problems were a great sign to me that I could learn a lot from working at EQ Works.
I had never done React or Node.js beforehand, but as I worked on the sample problems, I found that
each question presented a new type of problem or challenge that I had to overcome. Solving these
problems with the new tools forced me to step out of my comfort zone and create solutions using an
unfamiliar library. 

For example I had selected the Python variant of the question due to my familiarity with the language,
but since the data was retrieved through SQLAlchemy, also using Python, I had to figure out how
to bring the data objects to React. Through documentation and Stackoverflow forums, I discovered the
process of passing objects through the index.html template. The 4th question took the most time, as I 
had to probe around the Postgres database to realize that poi_id columns existed for the events and stats
data. Then the data had to be joined, and had to be filtered in a not-too-inefficient time. The map itself
works, albeit that it contains a couple bugs, one of which involves needing to click the first marker twice.

Overall, I found the experience rather enjoyable. After picking up React I made some plans to overhaul my own 
portfolio website with the library. I would love to be able to work on problems like this in the near future.
I hope that we may be able to discuss this opportunity soon.
